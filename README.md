The page aims to provide solutions for Affirm growth analytics take home assignment:
The two sql files are answers for Q1 and the slides target at Q2. 
Due to time limit, there're still lots of mysteries which haven't been explored. In slides, I only summarize key finding in high level.

  Questions:
  1. Imagine that each csv was actually a table of the same name within a data warehouse. Please provide the SQL that would
  address the following questions. Note that, for this question, we will be evaluating the quality of the SQL syntax rather than
  looking for a particular answer. Clearly state any assumptions as needed.
  a. How many users took out loans in March 2016 who were born in the 1980â€™s?
  b. Generate the SQL that would output the data structure below. Note that the actual values shown below are just
  samples for reference.
  
  
  2. Which merchant industry and/or user demographic would you focus business development on based on current checkout
  funnel and loan performance? Assume we have roughly the same market penetration in each so that saturation isn't a concern
  and assume revenue to Affirm = (mdr + loan_return_percentage) * loan_amount).
  a. Please put together a 2-3 page PowerPoint presentation to the executive team supporting your recommendations
  (title and agenda slides do not count in the total).
  b. As you are working through this question, please review the integrity of the data. Do you notice any data
  anomalies? If so, please describe them and how you would address them.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me!
